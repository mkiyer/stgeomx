The stgeomx package should be used to assist in the processing and
analysis of Nanostring Geomx RNA data. It has a novel background
correction function (qq) and a quantile normalization method that
correct for background noise in data generated by GeoMx. This package
can be used to load GeoMx data from xslx or tsv files, merge datasets
together, visualize the quality of the data then set thresholds to
filter out probes or ROIs, and apply the package’s background correction
and normalization to the data. See our manuscript for more information
about the package and see our vignette for step-by-step instructions on
how to use the package.
